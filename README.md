# aims

## base

- make a RL algorithm.
- plot learning progress
- show final
  - value table [if value iteration]
  - Q table [if Q learning]

## personal

- well documented
- good abstractions (parent classes, etc), wherever possible
- good use of public and private methods

# plan (technical)

- make `abstractions/` folder so you can try out both mdp and rl (value iteration and Q-learning)
