# Treasure cube

A Q-learning approach to reinforcement learning to solve the Treasure cube environment.

# Organisation

The agents are organizes in the `agents/` directory. It contains a `RandomAgent`(default) and a `QLearningAgent` (implemented by me). The directory is a submodule, and it's imported in both the test script and the notebook.

Suggested: use the notebook for easier visualisation viewing.
